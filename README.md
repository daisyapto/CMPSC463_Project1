# CMPSC463_Project1
Time-Series Clustering and Segment Analysis on PulseDB Using Divide-and-Conquer Algorithms

For this data analysis, the datatset file was obtained from Kaggle. Due to the size of the datatset,
only the 'VitalDB_CalBased_Test_Subset.mat' file was used in this analysis. Additonally, 'VitalDB_CalBased_Test_Subset.mat' is not
included in this repo because GitHub gives a file size warning for files over 25MB. For a full report on this project, view the
'CMPSC463_Project1_Report.pdf' file.
